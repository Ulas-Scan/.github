# UlaScan

Our project, UlaScan, is designed to revolutionize the online shopping experience on Tokopedia, a leading Indonesian e-commerce platform. Reading through countless reviews can be overwhelming and time-consuming, so we have created a smart tool to do the heavy lifting for you. UlaScan automatically reads, analyzes, and summarizes reviews using sentiment analysis and generative AI. This way, shoppers can quickly grasp the overall sentiment and key points from reviews, making it easier to make purchasing decisions.

- **Summarizer**: Generates concise summaries of reviews, highlighting the most important points and trends.
- **Statistics**: Provides detailed statistics on four aspects, including packaging, delivery, product condition, and admin response.
